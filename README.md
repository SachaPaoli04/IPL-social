## Description
IPL Social is a Node.js application designed to validate passwords based on specific criteria. The application includes a password checker that ensures passwords meet the following requirements:
- Must be at least 8 characters long.
- Must contain at least one special character.
- Must contain at least one digit.
- Must not contain the string "IPL" in any case (uppercase or lowercase).

The project uses Express to set up a simple server and Jasmine for unit testing to ensure the password validation logic works correctly.
